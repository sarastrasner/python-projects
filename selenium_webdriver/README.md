# Selenium Webdriver Projects


## Feature Tasks
1. Go to the game website and familiarise yourself with how it works: `http://orteil.dashnet.org/experiments/cookie/` 
1. Create a bot using Selenium and Python to click on the cookie as fast as possible.
1. Every 5 seconds, check the right-hand pane to see which upgrades are affordable and purchase the most expensive one. You'll need to check how much money (cookies) you have against the price of each upgrade.
1. After 5 minutes have passed since starting the game, stop the bot and print the "cookies/second".
1. Once you've managed to get the bot to work, feel free to tweak the algorithm if you think there is a better way to play the game. e.g. Change the time, instead of every 5 seconds to check the upgrades, what if you did every second. Or maybe the bot should buy all the affordable upgrades. Post your algorithm in the Q&A and impress us all if you manage to get a higher cookies/second with your algo.
