# Turtle Race
A digital turtle race built using event listeners, state, and multiple instances of Turtle Graphics. The user is 
asked to predict a winner, and each turtle takes a random number of steps until a winner crosses the finish line.

## Turtle Race Program Requirements
- Instantiate Turtle objects from [Turtle](https://docs.python.org/3/library/turtle.html)
- Ask the user who they think will win the Turtle Race
- For each color in a colors array, instantiate a turtle object of that color
- Place each turtle on the same x-axis toward the left of the screen
- Repetitively move each turtle forward a random distance until a winner crosses the finish line
- once a winner crosses the finish line
    - end all turtles' movement
    - let the user know if their prediction was correct
