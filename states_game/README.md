# States Guessing Game
A guessing game that prompts the user to name all 50 states. Correctly guessed states are labeled on a map. 
The states data is read and analyzed using the pandas library. The map is rendered using the turtle library. 
The game keeps a record of correct states and at the end of the game creates a csv file of states to study.
